    "text": "Main Goals\n\nStart from the basic question: What is the likelihood that a given asset’s price will rise or fall in the next few months?\nFind the most meaningful forward-looking information for asset prices. In the spirit of the most thoughtful global macro analytical approaches, incorporate loosely-correlated features that dimension various drivers of asset price formation: policy expectations, cyclical data evolution, cyclically sensitive asset dynamics, various risk premia, cross-asset class dynamics, etc.\nUse a machine-learning apparatus to aggregate these data into one summary metric. Prioritize interpretability and consistency to increase confidence in live performance.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe world is awash with research, commentary and anecdotal observations about asset prices. Tools like TradingView have enabled countless to dabble in the necromancy of technical analysis.\nStill, it is exceedingly rare to find the sort of analysis that takes a multifaceted approach; which conditions the overall view on the direction of prices on the state of many different drivers. In fact, the celebrated gut feel of well-known traders and investors may be a form of multi-dimensional analysis along these lines, which through experience and time, becomes instinct.\nWe have data at a high frequency for multiple decades making today a better time than ever for a more thorough investigation.\n\n\nBrief Illustrated Methodology:\n\nStart with the raw price series.  Turn it into connecting linear segments. It’s less noisy like this.  The linear segments move up or down, which determines the two regimes highlighted below.  Features used to predict regimes capture various relevant asset price drivers. Let’s make them comparable with some initial pre-processing. We will use lagged versions of these features to predict asset price regimes, enabling us to look forward at the risks of price increases or declines in coming months.\n Now we can calibrate model parameters with a gradually expanding training window. Many performance approaches exist. One is to save the last, more recent part of our dataset from any modeling work and compare metrics on this live set with the calibration test sets.\n  Finally, let’s examine regime predictions which summarise the risk of a given asset’s price rising or falling. Daily probability estimates arrive in advance of actual price action.\n\n\n\n   See the Indicators:"
